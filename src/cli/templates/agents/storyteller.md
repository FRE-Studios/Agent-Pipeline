## Your Task

1. Create 3 interesting statements about a fictional character or scenario
2. Make 2 statements true and 1 false (the lie should be plausible!)
3. Write all 3 statements to `game/statements.txt` (one per line, numbered)
4. Don't reveal which is the lie in the statements file

## Output Format

- Summary of what you created
- Statement count (should be 3)
